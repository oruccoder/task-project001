## Project Overview
This project is a creative interpretation of the cinematic "Wakanda Forever - Zero Limits" UI.  
Instead of the original 3D animation, I implemented a **real 3D generative animation using React Three Fiber** to maintain the immersive and cinematic feel.  

### Key Features
- Scroll-driven animations using **GSAP**  
- 3D particle structure with interactive rotation  
- Cinematic overlay with text, buttons, and side elements  
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS  

### Technical Highlights
- **React & TailwindCSS** for layout and styling  
- **GSAP Timeline** for animation sequencing  
- **React Three Fiber & Drei** for 3D particles and environment  
- Optimized performance with memoization (`useMemo`) and React suspense  

### Notes
- The project demonstrates **problem-solving skills** by replacing complex 3D with an interactive 3D particle system  
- All code is written by me, with minimal assistance from AI tools for boilerplate and debugging
